Software development methodologies (SDMs) can help a team to complete a project seamlessly. Selecting the right development methodology for a product organization depends largely on the team size, goals, and other factors. 

Almost all software development methodologies are non-technical. This means they do not deal with the technical aspects of software design and development. They focus more on the internal operations, and other processes involved in the project.

## 1. Waterfall
When it comes to software development, Waterfall is the most traditional and sequential choice. Although it’s usually viewed as an outdated method, it’s helpful to understand its structure to better appreciate the flexibility of more modern methodologies.

Waterfall requires plenty of structure and documentation up front. It is divided into self-contained stages. The first stage is vital, requiring a full understanding by both developers and stakeholders of the project’s demands and scope before anything begins.

#### _Strengths_
- Follows a clear and precise structure.
- Works well for small projects
- Transparency will not be an issue for both parties.
- Robust transfer of information from one phase to another because of its systematic approach.

#### _Weaknesses_
- High risk and uncertainty.
- It doesn’t encourage active participation of stakeholders.
- Inadequate for long-term projects.
- Not appropriate for projects with a moderate to high probability of change in requirements.

## 2. Agile
The Agile methodology was developed as a response to growing frustrations with Waterfall and other highly structured, inflexible methodologies. This approach is designed to accommodate change and the need to produce software faster. It aims to reduce risks such as bugs, cost overruns and sudden changes in software requirements.

Using the Agile approach, teams develop in short _iterations_ (also called _sprints_ in Scrum), each of which includes a defined duration and list of deliverables, but in no particular order. During iterations, teams work towards the goal of delivering working software (or some other tangible, testable output).

Agile is collaboration-heavy, focusing on team strengths and efficiency, along with internal feedback from various departments and customers. Customer satisfaction is the highest priority with the Agile approach, which teams achieve by continuously delivering working, tested, prioritized features.

#### Project lifecycle

The Agile lifecycle typically consists of six phases, found below, that can vary slightly based on the project methodology variant being used by the organization. The core of the agile workflow process lifecycle lies in experimentation and adaptability. 

1. **Concept**. Envision and prioritize projects.
2. **Inception**. Identify team members, appointment of funds, and discussion of initial environments and requirements.
3. **Iteration**. The development team works to deliver working software based on iteration requirements and feedback.
4. **Release**. Quality assurance (QA) testing, internal and external training, documentation development, and the iteration is put into production.
5. **Production**. Ongoing software support.
6. **Retirement**. End-of-life activities, including customer notification and migration.

There may be many projects operating simultaneously, multiple iterations running on different product lines, and a variety of stakeholders, both external and internal, with a range of business needs.

#### Iteration workflow
Agile _iterations_ are usually between two to four weeks long, with a final completion date pre-established.

</p>

1. **Requirements**. Define the deliverables for each iteration based on the product backlog. Product backlogs are lists made from the review/feedback stage of the previous iterations. This is often the most crucial stage of an iteration.
2. **Design**. The software development team will layout the project groundwork. From there, team members can collaborate to analyze each item. The discussion should include planning out the best course of action, best framework, and the best tools to achieve the best quality. The usage of diagrams and product mock-up are recommended during this stage.
3. **Development**. The team develops the next version of the software based on the requirements defined in the first stage.
4. **Testing**. Also called quality assurance (QA) more broadly, this part of the iteration process includes the development of the documentation, internal and external training, and QA testing.
5. **Deployment / Delivery**. The team integrates and delivers the working version of the software into production. Deliver your backlog items to your customer base for the final stage of testing.
6. **Review / Feedback**. The team elicits, analyzes, and uses feedback from customers and stakeholders to shape the next iteration's requirements. All feedback should be reviewed in the next iteration. Thus, starting another iteration workflow cycle.

#### Roles
These roles can have different naming conventions depending on the Agile methodology implementation.
- _**Product Owner**_: understands the customer and business requirements, creates and manages the product backlog based on those requirements.
- _**Team Leader**_ / _**Scrum Master**_: responsible for gluing everything together and ensuring that agile is being done well. In practical terms, that means they help the product owner to define value, the development team to deliver the value and get better. The team leader is a servant leader which not only describes a supportive style of leadership but describes what they do on a day-to-day basis.
- _**Development Team**_: composed of professionals who do the hands-on work of completing the tasks in a iteration / scrum sprint.
- _**Stakeholders**_: those who have an interest in the project that is being undertaken. They can be internal or external to the organization, and they may have a financial, operational, or strategic interest in the project.
- _**Customers**_: individuals who receive or purchase a product or service. A customer should have the ability to buy or rate this product or service. The feedback is frequently used to improve organizational processes and set requirements.

#### _Strengths_
- Face-to-face conversation with team members and stakeholders.
- Ensure and promote customer satisfaction.
- Adapts well with changing requirements.
- Fast and continuous development.
- Easy to manage with more flexibility.


#### _Weaknesses_
- Lack of formal documentation and designing.
- Difficulty in testing and test construction. Testing should be conducted continuously by the Agile team to ensure continuous development progress.
- Overall, it requires more time and energy from everyone.

## 3. Rapid
Rapid Application Development (RAD) is an agile project management strategy where the key benefits are efficiency and fast delivery, making it an attractive choice for developers working in a fast-paced environment. This rapid pace is made possible by RAD’s focus on minimizing the planning stage and maximizing prototype development. 

The end goal of the whole methodology is to deliver working software products to the market faster, as the demand for new applications is ever increasing. It is designed to be flexible to changes and to accept new inputs, like feedback and features, at every stage of the development process.

</p>

1. **Requirements**. Rather than spending months developing specifications with stakeholders, RAD begins by defining a loose set of requirements. "Loose" because among the key principles of rapid application development is the permission to change requirements at any point in the cycle.
2. **Prototype**. Once a project has been scoped, teams begin building out the initial models and prototypes. The goal is to rapidly produce a working design that satisfies all or only a portion of requirements. This prototype may cut corners to reach a working state, and that’s acceptable.
3. **Construction & Feedback gathering**. Rapid construction is where application coding, system testing, and unit integration occurs, converting prototype and beta systems into a working model. This stage may also be repeated as required, supporting new components and alterations. The majority of problems and customer changes were addressed during the iterative prototyping stage.
4. **Cutover**. During this stage, developers may optimize or even re-engineer their implementation to improve stability and maintainability. They may also spend this stage connecting the back-end to production data, writing thorough documentation, and doing any other maintenance tasks required before handing the product over with confidence.

#### _Strengths_
- Quick iterations drastically reduce development time and customers receive a working product within a shorter time frame.
- Development is focused on specific stakeholder requirements, instead of building features that could be removed from the final product, which saves time and money.
- Due to the constant feedback, developers can handle and resolve any issues in a timely manner, while ensuring a high-quality product.

#### _Weaknesses_
- It can be difficult to scale RAD, especially when working with larger teams, as this often requires frequent meetings with stakeholders in order to receive feedback. A small team can easily sync with each other, however, inter-team communication can slow down the process.
- Some developers can ignore best practices on the backend to accelerate development of the frontend focused prototype (interface-focus).
- If developers are not committed to delivering software on time, RAD projects can fail. For that reason it requires highly skilled professionals.

## 4. Scrum
Scrum is a system development methodology that implements agile development. The primary goal of Scrum is to satisfy the customer’s need through an environment of transparency in communication, collective responsibility and continuous progress.

Team members break down end goals into smaller goals at the beginning and work through them using fixed-length _sprints_ to build software and showcase it often, which usually last two weeks. Meetings play an important role in the Scrum approach, and during each sprint, daily planning meetings and demos take place to follow progress and gather feedback.

Scrum incorporates the structure and discipline of more traditional software development methodologies with the flexibility and iterative practices of modern Agile.

</p>

1. **Planning**. Defines what is going to be done in the sprint and how it is going to be done. This meeting is held at the beginning of each sprint and determines how to approach the project coming from the Product Backlog stages and deadlines. Each sprint is composed of different features.
2. **Implementation & Daily Scrum**. The objective of the Daily Scrum is to evaluate the progress and trend until the end of the sprint, synchronizing the activities and creating a plan for the next 24h. It is a brief meeting that takes place daily where three questions must be answered individually:  What did I do yesterday? What am I going to do today? What help do I need? The Scrum Master should try to solve problems or obstacles that arise.
3. **Review**. The goal of the sprint review is to show what work has been completed with regards to the Product Backlog for future deliveries. This can allow the team and key stakeholders to work together to brainstorm ideas for further improvements. This stage will determine if completed tasks can be removed from the backlog, or need to be added back.
4. **Retrospective**. This stage serves to implement improvements from the point of view of the development process. The goal of the sprint retrospective is to identify possible process improvements and generate a plan to implement them in the next sprint.

#### _Strengths_
- Large projects are divided into easily manageable sprints.
- Scrum, being agile, adopts feedback from customers and stakeholders.
- The team gets clear visibility through scrum meetings.
- The individual effort of each team member is visible during daily scrum meetings

#### _Weaknesses_
- The workflow can be easily compromised if individuals aren't very committed or cooperative.
- Difficult to estimate the resources, it lacks the end-to-end visibility of the software development process.
