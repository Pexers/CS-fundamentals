Cyber attacks are deliberate actions carried out by individuals, groups, or organizations to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of digital assets. These attacks can disrupt operations, steal sensitive information, cause financial loss, and damage reputations. As technology evolves, cyber threats become more sophisticated and widespread, making it essential for individuals and organizations to understand the various types of attacks and adopt effective security measures.

## Common Types of Cyber Attacks

### 1. Malware-based Attacks
- **Ransomware:** Encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.
- **Trojans:** Disguised as legitimate software, but perform malicious actions.
- **Viruses & Worms:** Self-replicate and spread to other systems.
- **Rootkits:** Gain unauthorized root or administrative access and hide their presence.
- **Drive-by Download Attacks:** Malicious code is installed when visiting compromised websites.
- **Cryptojacking:** Unauthorized use of computing resources to mine cryptocurrency.

### 2. Social Engineering Attacks
- **Phishing:** Deceptive emails, messages, or websites to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
	- *Spear Phishing:* Targeted at specific individuals or organizations.
	- *Whaling:* Targets high-profile individuals (executives).

### 3. Network Attacks
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) & Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):** Overwhelm systems with excessive traffic.
- **DNS Tunneling:** Uses DNS protocol to exfiltrate data or establish covert channels.
- **DNS Spoofing (Poisoning):** Manipulates DNS records to redirect users to malicious sites.

### 4. Web Application Attacks
- **SQL Injection:** Malicious SQL code manipulates databases.
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Injects malicious scripts into trusted websites.
- **URL Manipulation:** Alters URL parameters to access unauthorized data or perform malicious actions.

### 5. Credential Attacks
- **Password Attacks:** Attempts to obtain or crack passwords (brute force, dictionary, credential stuffing).
- **Session Hijacking:** Steals or manipulates session tokens to impersonate users.

### 6. Insider Threats
- **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent actions by individuals within an organization (employees, contractors).

## Prevention and Mitigation
- Keep software and systems updated.
- Use strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication.
- Educate users about phishing and social engineering.
- Employ firewalls, antivirus, and intrusion detection systems.
- Regularly back up data and test recovery procedures.
- Monitor network traffic and system logs for suspicious activity.
