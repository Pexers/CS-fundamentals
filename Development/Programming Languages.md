### Compiled Languages
Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage. Compiled languages need a "build" step – they need to be manually compiled first. You need to "rebuild" the program every time you need to make a change. 

Pure compiled languages:
- C
- C++
- Rust
- Go: the Go compiler turns the code into bytes ready to execute on a system which can run compiled C code.

### Interpreted Languages

Interpreted languages are those in which the source code is not directly executed by the hardware. Instead, another program, called an interpreter, reads and executes the instructions line by line or statement by statement. This process allows for greater flexibility and easier debugging, but traditionally comes at the cost of slower execution compared to compiled languages. Modern interpreters often use techniques like just-in-time (JIT) compilation to improve performance, narrowing the speed gap with compiled languages.

Common interpreted languages:
Popular interpreted languages include:
- Python (can also be compiled)
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- PHP

### Languages that are both Compiled and Interpreted

Many programming languages offer both compiled and interpreted implementations. The distinction often depends on how the language is used or the environment in which it runs, rather than the language itself.

For example:
 - **Python** can be run as a compiled program or interpreted interactively.
 - **Java** source code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)—acting as an interpreter or using JIT compilation.
 - **C#** is compiled into Intermediate Language (IL) files, which are executed by the .NET runtime.
 - **Kotlin** can be compiled to JVM bytecode or JavaScript, depending on the target platform.
