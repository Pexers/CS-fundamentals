Virtual Memory
Virtual memory is an area of a computer system's secondary memory storage space, such as an HDD or SSD, that acts as if it were a part of the system's RAM or primary memory.

Swap space
Like virtual memory, swap space is a secondary memory. It's used by the OS when there is no physical memory (RAM) available for further execution of the processes. If the OS faces a situation when it needs memory, but the RAM is full, it moves the inactive pages from RAM to swap memory. If these pages are needed in the future, the OS can move them again from swap space to RAM.
It offers a slower access time compared to RAM since it is located in the disk memory. Swap space is actually a part of the virtual memory.
