## ACID Properties

ACID is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions:

- **Atomicity:** All operations in a transaction are completed successfully, or none are (rollback).
- **Consistency:** A transaction transforms the database from one valid state to another, maintaining data integrity.
- **Isolation:** Changes made in a transaction are not visible to other transactions until the transaction is committed.
- **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, its changes persist even in the event of a system failure.

These properties ensure that database transactions are processed safely and reliably.
