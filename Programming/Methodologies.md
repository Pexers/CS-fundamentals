Software development methodologies (SDMs) can help a team to complete project seamlessly. Selecting the right development methodology for a product organization depends largely on the team size, goals, and other factors. 

Almost all software development methodologies are non-technical. This means they do not deal with the technical aspects of software design and development. They focus more on the internal operations, and other processes involved in the project.

## 2. Agile
The Agile methodology was developed as a response to growing frustrations with Waterfall and other highly structured, inflexible methodologies. This approach is designed to accommodate change and the need to produce software faster. It aims to reduce risks such as bugs, cost overruns and sudden changes in software requirements.

Using the Agile approach, teams develop in short _iterations_ (also called _sprints_ in Scrum), each of which includes a defined duration and list of deliverables, but in no particular order. During iterations, teams work towards the goal of delivering working software (or some other tangible, testable output).

Agile is collaboration-heavy, focusing on team strengths and efficiency, along with internal feedback from various departments and customers. Customer satisfaction is the highest priority with the Agile approach, which teams achieve by continuously delivering working, tested, prioritized features.

#### Project lifecycle

The Agile lifecycle typically consists of six phases, found below, that can vary slightly based on the project methodology variant being used by the organization. The core of the agile workflow process lifecycle lies in experimentation and adaptability. 

1. **Concept**. Envision and prioritize projects.
2. **Inception**. Identify team members, appointment of funds, and discussion of initial environments and requirements.
3. **Iteration**. The development team works to deliver working software based on iteration requirements and feedback.
4. **Release**. Quality assurance (QA) testing, internal and external training, documentation development, and the iteration is put into production.
5. **Production**. Ongoing software support.
6. **Retirement**. End-of-life activities, including customer notification and migration.
There may be many projects operating simultaneously, multiple iterations running on different product lines, and a variety of customers, both external and internal, with a range of business needs.

#### Iteration workflow
Agile _iterations_ are usually between two to four weeks long, with a final completion date pre-established.

1. **Requirements**. Define the deliverables for each iteration based on the product backlog. Product backlogs are lists made from the review/feedback stage of the previous iterations. This is often the most crucial stage of an iteration.
2. **Design**. The software development team will layout the project groundwork. From there, team members can collaborate to analyze each item. The discussion should include planning out the best course of action, best framework, and the best tools to achieve the best quality. The usage of diagrams and product mock-up are recommended during this stage.
3. **Development**. The team develops the next version of the software based on the requirements defined in the first stage.
4. **Testing**. Also called quality assurance (QA) more broadly, this part of the iteration process includes the development of the documentation, internal and external training, and QA testing.
5. **Deployment / Delivery**. The team integrates and delivers the working version of the software into production. Deliver your backlog items to your customer base for the final stage of testing.
6. **Review / Feedback**. The team elicits, analyzes, and uses feedback from the customer and other stakeholders to shape the next iteration's requirements. All feedback should be reviewed in the next iteration. Thus, starting another iteration workflow cycle.

#### _Strengths_
- Face-to-face conversation with team members and customers.
- Ensure and promote customer satisfaction.
- Adapts well with changing requirements.
- Fast and continuous development.
- Easy to manage with more flexibility.


#### _Weaknesses_
- Lack of formal documentation and designing.
- Difficulty in testing and test construction. Testing should be conducted continuously by the Agile team to ensure continuous development progress.
- Overall, it requires more time and energy from everyone.
