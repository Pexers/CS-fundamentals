# Computer Hardware Components

> **Note**  
> This document provides an overview of essential computer hardware components and their functions.

## CPU (Central Processing Unit)
The CPU is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing. Often referred to as the "brain" of the computer.

- **Key features**:
  - **Clock speed**: Measured in GHz, indicates how many instructions the processor can execute per second
  - **Cores**: Multiple processing units within a single CPU (dual-core, quad-core, etc.)
  - **Cache**: High-speed memory built into the CPU for quick access to frequently used data
  - **Architecture**: x86, x64, ARM, etc.

- **Popular manufacturers**: Intel, AMD, ARM

## Motherboard
The main circuit board that connects all components of a computer system.

- **Key components**:
  - **Chipset**: Controls communication between CPU, memory, and peripherals
  - **BIOS/UEFI**: Basic Input/Output System - firmware that initializes hardware during boot
  - **Expansion slots**: PCI, PCIe for adding components like graphics cards
  - **Sockets**: For CPU, RAM, and other components
  - **Form factors**: ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX (different sizes)

## RAM (Random Access Memory)
Temporary high-speed memory that stores data the CPU is actively using.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Volatile**: Loses data when power is cut
  - **Speed**: Measured in MHz/GHz
  - **Capacity**: Typically 4GB to 64GB in modern systems
  - **Types**: DDR4, DDR5 (Double Data Rate)
  - **Channels**: Single, dual, quad-channel configurations for increased bandwidth

## Storage Devices
### HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
- **Mechanical storage** using magnetic platters and moving read/write heads
- Higher capacity for lower cost
- Slower access times (5-10ms)
- More susceptible to physical damage
- Typical capacities: 1TB to 20TB

### SSD (Solid State Drive)
- **Flash memory-based** storage with no moving parts
- Faster access times (<0.1ms)
- More durable and energy-efficient
- Higher cost per GB than HDDs
- Typical capacities: 250GB to 4TB
- Types: SATA, NVMe (much faster)

## PSU (Power Supply Unit)
Converts AC power from wall outlets to DC power for computer components.

- **Specifications**:
  - **Wattage**: Typically 450W to 1200W for consumer systems
  - **Efficiency ratings**: 80 PLUS (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Titanium)
  - **Form factor**: ATX, SFX (for smaller cases)
  - **Modularity**: Non-modular, semi-modular, fully-modular (detachable cables)

## GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
Specialized processor designed to accelerate graphics rendering.

- **Uses**:
  - Gaming and 3D rendering
  - AI and machine learning
  - Video editing and content creation
  - Scientific computing

- **Specifications**:
  - **VRAM**: Video memory (4GB to 24GB)
  - **CUDA/Stream processors**: Parallel processing cores
  - **Memory bandwidth**: Speed of data transfer
  - **Popular manufacturers**: NVIDIA, AMD, Intel

## Optical Drives (CD/DVD/Blu-Ray)
Devices that read and sometimes write to optical discs.

- **Types**:
  - **CD**: ~700MB capacity
  - **DVD**: 4.7GB to 8.5GB capacity
  - **Blu-Ray**: 25GB to 50GB capacity

- **Uses**: Less common in modern systems as digital distribution becomes standard

## Cooling Systems
- **Air cooling**: Heat sinks and fans
- **Liquid cooling**: Closed-loop or custom water cooling systems
- **Passive cooling**: Heat sinks without fans for silent operation

## Input/Output Devices
- **Peripherals**: Keyboard, mouse, monitors
- **Ports**: USB, HDMI, DisplayPort, Ethernet, audio jacks
- **Expansion cards**: Sound cards, capture cards, network adapters

## Network Hardware
- **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: Built into most motherboards
- **Wi-Fi adapters**: For wireless connectivity
- **Bluetooth modules**: For connecting to Bluetooth peripherals
