Linux CLI Cheat Sheet

Bash (Bourne Again SHell) vs Shell
`#!/bin/bash`
`#!/bin/sh`

Which one to use?
Prefer sh for the following reasons:

- it is standardized
- it is much simpler and easier to learn
- it is portable across POSIX systems â€” even if they happen not to have bash, they are required to have sh.

There are advantages to using bash as well. Its features make programming more convenient and similar to programming in other modern programming languages. These include things like scoped local variables and arrays. Plain sh is a very minimalistic programming language.
